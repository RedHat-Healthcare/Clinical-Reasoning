# Clinical Reasoning
This is the Clincial Reasoning Platform central repository. It is designed to be a launch point for content and all the specific components and additional artifacts that enable and make Clinical Reasoning an extensible platform can be found. For general awareness, any Clinical Reasoning components ARE ONLY intended to be run within resources that leverage the needed upstream software or equivalent licensed software as defined below within the content. In addition, this effort through its open source licensing selection ensures appropriate protection for all parties. Red Hat Healthcare is doing this to help the broader healthcare community and while a market within Red Hat this is an independant effort.
